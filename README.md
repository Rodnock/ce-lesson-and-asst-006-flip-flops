### Section 1: Capacitors

**1.3.1. A short narrative about the experiment. What is the voltage when the capacitor finishes charging? Why?**  

This is a fairly straightforward experiment to demonstraight a capacitor charging and discharging. When the capacitor is        fully charge, it stores 5v when it finishes charging because that is all the voltage we are putting into it. Just as if I have the board set to 3.3v, the capacitor stops charging at 3.3v.

**1.3.2.The approximate time to charge and discharge the capacitor. (2 values)**

The capacitor charges almost instantly. The discharge takes about a minute.

**1.3.3.An instantaneous value for the charging and discharging currents. (2 values) Note: These currents are not constant, and with this equipment we may only be able to capture an instantaneous non-zero current value.**

I was unable to get any readings for this.

### Section 2: Logic Level Converter

**2.3.1. A short narrative about the experiment.**

This experiment demonstraights how to use the voltage converter to utilize both the 5v from the bread board, and the 3.3v from the microbit.

**2.3.2 Short video of the operation of the circuit from 2.2.3.**

**2.3.3 Short video of the operation of the circuit from 2.2.5.**

Video: https://imgur.com/a/w0J0IIl (I wanted to show that the LED was being controlled by pin 8, and not just on by default, I didn't realize until after that this was what we were supposed to do for 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, so those will be the same.)

### Section 3: Clock signal from the micro:bit

**3.3.1 A short narrative about the experiment.**

This experiment introduces flip flops and square waves, so sort of a "timing" for things turning on and off using binary 0 and 1.

**3.3.2 Short video of the operation of the circuit from 3.2.2.**

Video: https://imgur.com/a/7EPccS8 (Same code as 2.3.3)

**3.3.3 Short video of the operation of the circuit from 3.2.3.**

Video: https://imgur.com/a/x7yPYUc (I also added a A+B button press to make the timing go back to normal)

### Section 4: D-type flip-flop

**4.3.1 A short narrative about the experiment.

**4.3.2 An image with your hand-drawn diagram of the whole circuit. Use boxes for the micro:bit, converter board, and the flip-flop chip. Label all pins.

**4.3.3 Short video of the operation of the circuit from 4.2.6.

Video: https://imgur.com/a/9bmkHth (I didn't see any difference in the circuit operation between 4.2.6 and 4.2.7. There was no noticable lag no matter what the timing was, as you can see in this video.)
